Testing ecf directory:
  /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/ecf/cam.dev/stats

  There are 2 ecf files:
   jevs_href_grid2obs_stats.ecf
   jevs_href_precip_stats.ecf
 
   These 2 ecf jobs have no relationship, so they can be run at same time


Submit jobs:
  qsub jevs_href_grid2obs_stats.ecf
  qsub jevs_href_precip_stats.ecf 

  Note: since "#PBS -j oe" is set, the stdout file will be in the submit directory
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/ecf/cam.dev/stats

The running directory (i.e. $DATA) will be in /lfs/h2/emc/ptmp/${USER}/evs/tmpnwprd:
  
  evs_href_grid2obs_stats.$jobid for both jevs_href_cnv_stats.ecf and jevs_href_grid2obs_stats.ecf
  evs_href_precip_stats.$jobid

  jobid is automatically created ($$) during the run


The running has 4 stages for each job

 (0) Check validation data, including observation data and HREF ensemble member files and ensemble product files
      If observation data is missing, the run will stop 
      If any href member(s) is(are) missing, the run will stop
      If href member files are missing for all forecast hours, the run will stop

    IF none of above happen, go following stages

 (1) Run METplus to process PB2NC prepbufr files (grid2obs) or PCP_Combine 3hr, 24hr  CCPA/MRMS  data and href's 3hr and 24hr APCP data files (precip)

     After finished, 
     the prepbufr files are in  $DATE/prepbufr.vdate sub-directory  
     the pcp_combine files are in $DATA/ccpa.vdate, href.initdate1, href.initdate2, href.initdate3, href.initdate4, and href.initdate5
     Since there will be 5 days and 26 href member's 6hr APCP need to be generated, it will take a while to complete this procedure 

 (2) Run METplus to generate stat files
 
     For grid2obs 
       All of output stat files will be in the $DATA/grid2obs
     For precip 
       All of output stat files will be in  the $DATA/precip
       in which there are several sub-directories. Each sub-directory is corresponding to one parallel job
 
    In each job's directory, there are 3 sub directories
          logs, stats, and tmp
       
    The small stat files are stored in the stats sub-directory.  For grid2obs and precip , the small stat files have 3 types:
          (1) ensemble_stat*.stat
          (2) point_stat*CNV*.stat 
          (3) point_stat*MEAN*.stat (grid2obs) or grid_stat*MEAN*.stat (precip)
          (4) point_stat*PROB*.stat (grid2obs) or grid_stat*PROB*.stat (precip)

    The small stat files are stored in directory /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/com/evs/v1.0/stats/cam/atmos.$VDATE/href
       grid2obs and precip, respectively 
       

 (3) Combine the small stat files to a large stat file

   The small stat files  are then combined (by StatAnalysis tool) into a large stat file
   called href_grid2obs_v$DATE.stat, and href_precip_v$VDATE.stat

   This large stat file is stored in the directory 
      /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/com/evs/v1.0/stats/cam/href.$VDATE

  The StatAnalysis METplus output_base directory is $DATA/gather, in which all of running info are stored
