Instruction for tesing EVS global_ens package:

 General information

  The EVS global_ens verifies 4 global ensembles (models) over 1x1 global grid (G003) 
     (1) NCEP's Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)
     (2) Canadian Meteorologic Center's Ensemble (CMCE)
     (3) Europe Center's Medium-range Ensemble (ECME) 
     (4) NCEP's North American Ensemble Forecast System (NAEFS) 

   According to EVS, 3 "RUN"s assigned for the verification of these models:
     (1) Atmos ( for GEFS, CMCE, ECME, NAEFS)
     (2) WMO ( for GEFS, CMCE)
     (3) Headline (for GEFS, NAEFS)
          As comparison, GFS is also inluded for reference

   Each RUN has different verification types:
      Atmos:     grid2grid, grid2obs, precipitation, snowfall, sea-ice, SST, cnv (ceiling and visibility)
      WMO:       grid2grid 
      Headline:  grid2grid
     
   
 
0. Before testing, please compile the Fortran source codes that are required to process NAEFS member data:
    
    (1) go to /sorc sub-directory under EVS
    (2) run script compile_evs_global_ens_sorc.sh that compiles the Fortran codes in the directory evs_global_ens_adjust_CMCE_NAEFS.fd
        If the complation is successful, the execution file evs_g2g_adjustCMC.x will be stored in the sub-directory /exec under EVS
    The compilation is just once. If the compilation is successful, then can test the prep and stats ecf as shown below.
 

1. Testing ecf directory:
 
  
  (1)  prep ecf testing directory

    Since the global_ens verifies 16 days of the ensemble forecast while the operational data are retained only for few days,
    it is necessary to retain them for at least 16 days. But the global ensemble member files are very large and will occupy
    huge storage space. To reduce the storage space, they are thinned by retireving only required fields. The second reason
    is raw ensemble files are not G003. One of prep task to converting them to G003 grid. This also save large storage space.
    The prep jobs also process required observation data, such as prepbufr, ccap, osi_saf, ghrsst, nohrsc data, etc. 
   
  The testing prep ecf files are in the directory:
     /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/ecf/global_gens.dev/prep

    There are 2 ecf files:

       jevs_global_ens_atmos_prep.ecf  
       jevs_global_ens_headline_prep.ecf

  After jevs_global_ens_atmos_prep.ecf is successfully finished, the prepared data are stored in directory
 
     /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/com/evs/v1.0/prep/global_ens

     Under which the daily data are in directory atmos.$INITDATE and headline.$INIDATE, respectovely 
 
  (2) stats ecf testing directory 

  /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/ecf/global_gens.dev/stats
    There are 23  ecf files, 10 for gefs, 5 for cmce, 4 for ecme and 4 for naefs

  gefs:
    jevs_gefs_atmos_grid2grid_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_atmos_grid2obs_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_atmos_precip_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_atmos_snowfall_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_atmos_sea_ice_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_atmos_sst_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_atmos_cnv_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_wmo_grid2grid_stats.ecf
    jevs_gefs_headline_grid2grid_stats.ecf
    jevs_gfs_headline_grid2grid_stats.ecf

  cmce:
    jevs_cmce_atmos_grid2grid_stats.ecf
    jevs_cmce_atmos_grid2obs_stats.ecf
    jevs_cmce_atmos_precip_stats.ecf
    jevs_cmce_atmos_snowfall_stats.ecf
    jevs_cmce_wmo_grid2grid_stats.ecf

  ecme:
    jevs_ecme_atmos_grid2grid_stats.ecf
    jevs_ecme_atmos_grid2obs_stats.ecf
    jevs_ecme_atmos_precip_stats.ecf
    jevs_ecme_atmos_snowfall_stats.ecf
  
  naefs:
    jevs_naefs_atmos_grid2grid_stats.ecf
    jevs_naefs_atmos_grid2obs_stats.ecf
    jevs_naefs_atmos_precip_stats.ecf
    jevs_naefs_headline_grid2grid_stats.ecf

2. Submit jobs:

  Note (1):
   The ecf files in the prep directories must be submitted at first. After they are finished
     the ecf files in the stats directory can be submitted.

  Note (2): in the prep directory, jevs_global_ens_atmos_prep.ecf must be submitted first.
    Waiting for at lease 3 hr and 45 min (after the first job is finished), submit jevs_global_ens_headline_prep.ecf
    The second job will be finsihed within 10min

  Note (3): After 2 jobs in the prep directory are finished, can submit all 23 ecf files.
    Since these 23 ecf files are not associated, they can be submitted  at same time   

  Note (4): since "#PBS -j oe" is set, the stdout file will be in the submit directory
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/ecf/global_gens.dev/prep or 
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/ecf/global_gens.dev/stats 

  I run the test by running following 2 scripts 
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/EVS/ecf/global_ens.dev/prep/submit_prep.sh
   which qsub qsub jevs_global_ens_atmos_prep.ecf,
   then sleep 4h, then qsub jevs_global_ens_headline_prep.ecf
  and
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/EVS/ecf/global_ens.dev/stats/submit_gens_for_day_all.sh 
   which qsub all 23  stats ecf at same time

3. Prepared output data structure:

  The ecf job will rettrieve the observation data files and global ensemble member files
   then thin them by grabbing required fields and save the thinned files in 

      /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/com/evs/v1.0/prep/global_ens directory.

        in which  there are /atmos.$ININDATE (103G each) and /headline.$INITDATE (44M each) sub-directories

      In the /atmos.$ININDATE subdirectory, there are 4 sub-directories
              /cmce  /ecme  /gefs  /osi_saf
      The /cmce, /ecme and /gefs  store cmce, ecme and gefs  member files and their analysis files, respectively
      The /osi_saf stores 24h osi_saf files

      The /gefs also store prebufr, ccpa, hgrsst, nohrsc data files
 
      In headline.$INITDATE, there are /cmce and /gefs sub-directories, storing the cmce and gefs headline member files.

   Note: in operarion, atmos.$INITDATA will be retained for 20 days, and headline.$INITDATE will be retained for 13 months

4. Running the stats ecf
 
  The running directory (i.e. $DATA) will be in /lfs/h2/emc/ptmp/${USER}/evs/tmpnwprd:
 
  The running has 4 stages for each ecf file

 (0) Check validation data, including observation data and ensemble member files and ensemble product files
      If observation data is missing, the run will stop 
      If any  member(s) is(are) missing, the run will stop
      If member files are missing for all forecast hours, the run will stop

    IF none of above happen, go following stages

 (1) Run METplus to generate stat files
 
       All of output stat files will be in the $DATA/$VARIF_CASE
 
    In each job's directory, there are 3 sub directories
          /logs, /stats, and /tmp
 
    The /stats sub-directory is where the stat files (small stat files) generated by METplus

    After all of the small stat files are generated, the gather process combines them into a big stat files         

    The small stat files are stored in directory 
        /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USeR/com/evs/v1.0/stats/global_gens/atmos.$VDATE/${model}
    The big stat files are stored in directory
        /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USeR/com/evs/v1.0/stats/global_gens/atmos.$VDATE/${model}

   Speficically: 

    for /gefs (9 stat files), 20221109 as example:
      evs.stats.gefs_atmos_cnv_v20221109.stat        
      evs.stats.gefs_atmos_snowfall_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.gefs_atmos_grid2grid_v20221109.stat  
      evs.stats.gefs_atmos_sst24h_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.gefs_atmos_grid2obs_v20221109.stat   
      evs.stats.gefs_headline_grid2grid_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.gefs_atmos_precip_v20221109.stat     
      evs.stats.gefs_wmo_grid2grid_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.gefs_atmos_sea_ice_v20221109.stat

    for cmce (5 stat files)
      evs.stats.cmce_atmos_grid2grid_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.cmce_atmos_snowfall_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.cmce_atmos_grid2obs_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.cmce_wmo_grid2grid_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.cmce_atmos_precip_v20221109.stat

    for ecme (4 stat files)
      evs.stats.ecme_atmos_grid2grid_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.ecme_atmos_precip_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.ecme_atmos_grid2obs_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.ecme_atmos_snowfall_v20221109.stat
   
    for naefs (4 stat files)
      evs.stats.naefs_atmos_grid2grid_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.naefs_atmos_precip_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.naefs_atmos_grid2obs_v20221109.stat
      evs.stats.naefs_headline_grid2grid_v20221109.stat
   
    for gfs (1 stat file)
      evs.stats.gfs_headline_grid2grid_v20221109.stat

If all of above big files are generated, the stats execution is completeted.
The standard output of all of ecf jobs are stored in the ecf directory:
/lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/ecf/global_ens.dev/stats
Under which, the small stat files are saved in atmos.$VDATE, wmo.$VDATE and headline.$VDATE
The large stat files are saved in gefs.$VDATE, cmce.$VDATE, ecme.$VDATE, and naefs.$VDATE 
 (atmos, wmo, and headline stat files are save in the same model's directory)  


Please Note: Only ater the retained prepared forecat files are accumulated for 16 days,
(after running the prep ecf for 16 days), the verification of all forecast 384 hours
can be done. If less than 16 days of days are retained, the verification of longer forecast
hours will be missing.
