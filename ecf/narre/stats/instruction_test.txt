Testing has 2 steps:

Step 1.

   cd  /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/evs.v1.0/ecf/narre.dev/stats

Step 2. type following 

   qsub jevs_narre_stats.ecf

   Note: since "#PBS -j oe" is set, the stdout file will be in the submit directory
     /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/evs.v1.0/ecf/narre.dev/stats

Note, if want to run nteractive mode, edit jevs_narre_stats.ecf file by changing 
export run_mpi=yes --> export run_mpi=no, then type
jevs_narre_stats.ecf 

The running directory (i.e. $DATA) will be in /lfs/h2/emc/ptmp/${USER}/evs/tmpnwprd  
evs_narre_grid2obs_stats.$jobid

jobid is automatically created ($$) during the run

The running has 3 stages

 (1) Run METplus to process PB2NC prepbufr files

       After finished, the processed prepbufr data are in sub-directory $DATA/prepbufr.20221002  

 (2) Run METplus to generate stat files
    
     This step is to verify  NARRE's ensemble mean by PointStat tool

       All of output for stat genration is in the sub-directory grid2obs

       After the stage (1) is finished, following 8 job scripts are generated for MPI run 

        run_narre_narremean.CONUS.range1.sh   
        run_narre_narremean.CONUS.range2.sh
        run_narre_narremean.CONUS.range3.sh
        run_narre_narremean.CONUS.range4.sh
        run_narre_narremean.Alaska.range1.sh  
        run_narre_narremean.Alaska.range2.sh  
        run_narre_narremean.Alaska.range3.sh  
        run_narre_narremean.Alaska.range4.sh  


       The METplus output_base for each jobs are in grid2obs
         such as run_narre_narremean.CONUS.range1 

       In each job's output_base directory, there are 3 sub directories
          logs, stats, and tmp
       
        The small stat files are stored in the stats.

 (3) Combine the small stat files to a large stat file

     After the small stat files of all of the 8 jobs are created, they will be copied to 
    the directory 
       /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/${USER}/com/evs/v1.0/stats/narre/atmos.$VDATE

   Thes small stat files then are combined (by StatAnalysis tool) into a large stat file
   called NARRE_MEAN_grid2obs_20221002.stat
   This large stat file is stored in the directory 
      /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/com/evs/v1.0/stats/narre.$VDATE

   The StatAnalysis METplus output_base directory is $DATA/gather, in which all of running info are stored
