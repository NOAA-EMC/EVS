# NCEP EMC PYTHON PLOTTING OF CAM VERIFICATION

# CONTRIBUTORS:     Marcel Caron, marcel.caron@noaa.gov, NOAA/NWS/NCEP/EMC-VPPPGB
#
# PURPOSE:          Set up configurations to plot METPLUS output statistics
#
# DESCRIPTION:      This configuration file defines environment variables that are meant to be 
#                   edited by the user and that are called by python scripts at runtime to define 
#                   the plotting task, resulting in one or more graphics output files. 
#
# BEFORE YOU BEGIN: Make sure to set up verif_plotting if you haven't already. 
#
#
#                   On the NOAA WCOSS supercomputer, choose any directory that will house 
#                   verif_plotting.  As an example, we'll call that directory PY_PLOT_DIR.  Then on 
#                   the command line:
#
#                   $ PY_PLOT_DIR="/path/to/my/verif/plotting/home/directory"
#                   $ mkdir -p ${PY_PLOT_DIR}/out/logs ${PY_PLOT_DIR}/data ${PY_PLOT_DIR}/ush
#                   $ cp -r ${BASE_DIR}/ush/* ${PY_PLOT_DIR}/ush/.
#                   $ cp ${BASE_DIR}/py_plotting.config ${PY_PLOT_DIR}/.
#
# CONFIGURATION:    After setting up verif_plotting, edit the exported variables below.  Each 
#                   variable is a string that will be ingested by the python code.  You'll need to 
#                   be able to point to a correctly structured metplus statistics archive (see the 
#                   comment for Directory Settings below for details).  
#
#                   LIMITATIONS   
#                   In some cases, possible values for exported variables will be limited to what 
#                   is listed in the metplus .stat files or the statistics archive you are using 
#                   (e.g., values for FCST_LEAD or MODEL).  In other cases, possible values will be 
#                   limited to what has been predefined elsewhere in verif_plotting (e.g., values 
#                   for EVAL_PERIOD).  Finally, some settings must match certain allowable settings, 
#                   which are defined in ${USH_DIR}/settings.py in the case_type attribute of the 
#                   Reference() class.  Two asterisks mark these latter settings in the 
#                   comments below. 
#
#                   CONFIGURING PLOT TYPE
#                   The plot type is requested via the last export variable.  Replace the string with 
#                   the desired plot type as explained in the comment.  In most cases, a plot will 
#                   include all of the listed settings; for example, the python code will attempt to
#                   plot all of the listed models in MODEL on the same plot, as well as all of the 
#                   init/valid hours in FCST_INIT/VALID_HOUR and lead times in FCST_LEAD.  
#                   Exceptions to this are any listed var_names and listed domains (VX_MASK_LIST), 
#                   for which individual plots will be made. Listed levels are also plotted 
#                   separately unless the plot type is stat_by_level.
#
# EXECUTION:        After configuring this script, it can be run on the command line:
#
#                   $ /bin/sh ${PY_PLOT_DIR}/py_plotting.config
#
#                   ... which will set the environment variables and run the python code. The python 
#                   code then follows these steps:
#                   (1) Save environment variables as global python variables. Check these variables
#                       and throw an error if an issue is encountered and throw warnings as needed. 
#                       Make sure the datatype for each variable is correct
#                   (2) Send the settings to ${USH_DIR}/df_preprocessing.py, which pulls and prunes 
#                       the .stat files--creating temporary data files in the process and storing 
#                       those files in PRUNE_DIR--then loads the data as pandas dataframes, which 
#                       are filtered several times according to user settings. 
#                   (3) Send the dataframe and user settings to a plotting function, which creates a 
#                       figure object, filters the data, plots the data, adjusts plot features, then 
#                       saves the plot as a png.
#
# DEBUGGING:        Part of the configuration for this script involves setting a logfile path. 
#                   Running the script will print the logfile path for your specific task, which you 
#                   can check for debugging.  The lowest log level that is currently functional is 
#                   "INFO". "DEBUG" statements may be included in a later implementation.
#
