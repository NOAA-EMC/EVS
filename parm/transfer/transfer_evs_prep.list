# This file specifies the directories to be tranatmfered and, optionally, the files within
# those directories to include or exclude.  If one directory is specified per line, it
# will be used as both the source and destination.  If two directories are specified per
# line, separated by one or more spaces, the first will be used as the source and the
# second the destination.  Directories that begin with "com/" will be resolved using
# the compath.py utility.  Rules may be placed below each directory or directory pair
# and must begin with one of the following characters:
#  -  exclude, specifies an exclude pattern
#  +  include, specifies an include pattern
#  .  merge, specifies a merge-file to read for more rules
#  :  dir-merge, specifies a per-directory merge-file
#  H  hide, specifies a pattern for hiding files from the tranatmfer
#  S  show, files that match the pattern are not hidden
#  P  protect, specifies a pattern for protecting files from deletion
#  R  risk, files that match the pattern are not protected
#  !  clear, clears the current include/exclude list (takes no arg)
#  B  bytes, relative size of the path in relation to the other paths in the list
#  D  delete, delete extraneous files from destination directories (takes no arg)
#  E  encrypt, enables data encryption [two cores should be allocated] (takes no arg)
#  W  whole files, copy whole files rather than use delta-xfer algorithm (takes no arg)  (v2.2.3+)
#  T  two-way syncronization will update both sides with latest changes (takes no arg)
#  Z  compress data as it is sent, accepts optional compression level argument (1-9)
# Rules higher in the list take precedence over lower ones.  By default, all files in a
# directory are included, so if no exclude patterns match that file, it will be
# tranatmferred.
